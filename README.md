Drawing inspiration from physics interaction systems
found in games like Amnesia: The Dark Descent,
The Bunker, and SOMA, this Unity C# script 
offers functionality to pick up, move, 
and throw physics objects, as well as 
interact with doors, levers, and any 
other object equipped with a Rigidbody component.

How to use it: 
1. Create a prefab with a small standart sphere object inside (or anything small). sphere object is used for debug purposes only.
2. Attach sphere prefab and 2 images as UI Image elements to the script in editor.
3. Attach main camera.
4. Enjoy!

The script only works with rigidbody objects.

Tested on Unity 2022.3.14f1 HDRP
